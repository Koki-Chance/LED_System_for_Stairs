# LED_System_for_Stairs
This system turns on a light when someone go up or down the stairs. You don't need to control this system because this system automatically controls the LEDs when the light is needed to be turned on. When you are in front of the stairs, the light is immediately turned on so that you can smoothly move between the 2 floors.

This project is written in Arduino Programming Language(C++).

## Purpose
To prevent an accident in stairs. This system automatically turns on the LEDs installed on the stairs, therefore the resident can avoid accident when it's dim. It is dangerous to walk on the stairs at night without turning on the light because of several reasons. In my case, I often kick the cat accidentaly when I go up to the the 2nd floor from te 1st floor.

## Key Components

# Getting Started
Upload the The main project file is "LED_System_for_Stairs_ver.9.ino". Other files are mainly the patterns of LEDs.

LED Installation on stairs is required.
